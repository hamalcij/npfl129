# Support Vector Machines

In order to solve the constrained problem of
$$\argmin_{w,b} \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 \textrm{~given that~~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1,$$
we write the Lagrangian with multipliers $→a=(a_1, …, a_N)$ as
$$L = \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 - ∑_i a_i \big[t_i y(→x_i) - 1\big].$$

Setting the derivatives with respect to $→w$ and $b$ to zero, we get
$$\begin{aligned}
→w =& ∑_i a_i t_iφ(→x_i), \\
 0 =& ∑_i a_i t_i. \\
\end{aligned}$$

---
# Support Vector Machines

Substituting these to the Lagrangian, we get
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j)$$
with respect to the constraints $∀_i: a_i ≥ 0$, $∑_i a_i t_i = 0$
and kernel $K(→x, →z) = φ(→x)^T φ(→z).$

The solution of this Lagrangian will fulfil the KKT conditions, meaning that
$$\begin{aligned}
a_i &≥ 0, \\
t_i y(→x_i) - 1 &≥ 0, \\
a_i \big(t_i y(→x_i) - 1\big) &= 0.
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, either a point is on a boundary, or $a_i=0$. Given that the
predictions for point $→x$ are $y(→x) = ∑ a_i t_i K(→x, →x_i) + b$,
we need to keep only the points on the boundary, the so-called **support vectors**.
Even if SVM is nonparametric model, it stores only a subset of data.

# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

![w=28%,f=right](svm_softmargin.svgz)

Until now, we assumed the data to be linearly separable – the  
**hard-margin SVM** variant. We now relax this condition to arrive at
**soft-margin SVM**.
~~~
The idea is to allow points to be in the margin or even on the _wrong side_ of
the decision boundary. We introduce _slack variables_ $ξ_i ≥ 0$, one for each
training instance, defined as
$$ξ_i = \begin{cases} 0 &\textrm{~for points fulfilling~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1,\\
                      |t_i - y(→x_i)|&\textrm{~otherwise}.\end{cases}$$

~~~
Therefore, $ξ_i=0$ signifies a point outside of margin, $0 < ξ_i < 1$ denotes
a point inside the margin, $ξ_i=1$ is a point on the decision boundary and
$ξ_i>1$ indicates the point is on the opposite side of the separating
hyperplane.

~~~
Therefore, we want to optimize
$$\argmin_{w,b} C ∑_i ξ_i + \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 \textrm{~given that~~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1 - ξ_i\textrm{~and~}ξ_i ≥ 0.$$

---
# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

We again create a Lagrangian, this time with multipliers $→a=(a_1, …, a_N)$
and also $→μ=(μ_1, …, μ_N)$:
$$L = \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 + C ∑_i ξ_i - ∑_i a_i \big[t_i y(→x_i) - 1 + ξ_i\big] - ∑_i μ_i ξ_i.$$

~~~
Solving for the critical points and substituting for $→w$, $b$ and $→ξ$ (obtaining an additional
constraint $μ_i = C - a_i$ compared to the previous case), we obtain the Lagrangian in the form
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j),$$
which is identical to the previous case, but the constraints are a bit
different:
$$∀_i: C ≥ a_i ≥ 0\textrm{~and~}∑_i a_i t_i = 0.$$

---
# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

Using KKT conditions, we can see that the support vectors (examples with
$a_i>0$) are the ones with $t_i y(→x_i) = 1 - ξ_i$, i.e., the examples
on the margin boundary, inside the margin and on the opposite side
of the decision boundary.

section: Hinge
# SGD-like Formulation of Soft-Margin SVM

Note that the slack variables can be written as
$$ξ_i = \max\big(0, 1 - t_i y(→x_i)\big),$$
so we can reformulate the soft-margin SVM objective using the **hinge loss**
$$𝓛_\textrm{hinge}(t, y) ≝ \max(0, 1 - t y)$$
to
$$\argmin_{w,b} C ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{hinge}\big(t_i, y(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 .$$

~~~
Such formulation is analogous to a regularized loss, where $C$ is an _inverse_
regularization strength, so $C=∞$ implies no regularization and $C=0$ ignores
the data entirely.

# Comparison of Linear and Logistic Regression and SVM

For $y(→x; →w, b) ≝ →φ(→x)^T →w + b$, we have seen the following losses:

| Model | Objective | Per-Instance Loss |
|:------|:----------|:------------------|
| Linear<br>Regression | $\small \argmin_{→w,b} ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{MSE}\big(t_i, y(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} λ \|→w\|^2$ | $\small 𝓛_\textrm{MSE}(t, y) = \frac{1}{2}(t - y)^2$ |
| Logistic<br>regression | $\small \argmin_{→w,b} ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{σ-NLL}\big(t_i, y(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} λ \|→w\|^2$ | $\small 𝓛_\textrm{σ-NLL}(t, y) = - \log \begin{pmatrix}σ(y)^t +\\ \big(1-σ(y)\big)^{1-t}\end{pmatrix}$ |
| Softmax<br>regression | $\small \argmin_{⇉W,→b} ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{s-NLL}\big(t_i, y(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} λ \|→w\|^2$ | $\small 𝓛_\textrm{s-NLL}(t, →y) = - \log \softmax(→y)_t$ |
| SVM | $\small \argmin_{→w,b} C ∑_i 𝓛_\textrm{hinge}\big(t_i, y(→x_i)\big) + \frac{1}{2} \|→w\|^2$ | $\small 𝓛_\textrm{hinge}(t, y) = \max(0, 1 - ty)$ |

~~~
Note that $\small 𝓛_\textrm{MSE}(t, y) ∝ -\log\big(𝓝(t; μ=y, σ^2=\mathrm{const})\big)$ and
$\small 𝓛_\textrm{σ-NLL}(t, y) = 𝓛_\textrm{s-NLL}(t, [y, 0])$.

# Binary Classification Loss Functions Comparison

To compare various functions for binary classification, we need to formulate
them all in the same settings, with $t ∈ \{-1, 1\}$.

~~~
- MSE: $(ty - 1)^2$, because it is $(y - 1)^2$ for $t=1$ and $(-y - t)^2$ for $t=-1$,
~~~
- LR: $-\log σ(ty)$, because it is $σ(y)$ for $t=1$ and $1-σ(y)=σ(-y)$ for $t=-1$,
~~~
- SVM: $\max(0, 1 - ty)$.

# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

To solve the dual formulation of a SVM, usually Sequential Minimal Optimization
(SMO; John Platt, 1998) algorithm is used.

~~~
Before we introduce it, we start by introducing **coordinate descent**
optimization algorithm.

~~~
Consider solving unconstrained optimization problem
$$\argmin_→w L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D).$$

~~~
Instead of the usual SGD approach, we could optimize the weights one by one,
using the following algorithm

<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence
  - for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$:
    - $w_i ← \argmin\nolimits_{w_i} L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D)$
</div>

# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence
  - for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$:
    - $w_i ← \argmin\nolimits_{w_i} L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D)$
</div>

![w=42%,f=right](coordinate_descent.svgz)

If the inner $\argmin$ can be performed efficiently, the coordinate descent can
be fairly efficient.

~~~
Note that we might want to choose $w_i$ in different order, for example
by trying to choose $w_i$ providing the largest decrease of $L$.

~~~
The Kernel linear regression dual formulation was in fact trained
by a coordinate descent – updating a single $β_i$ corresponds
to updating weights for a single example.

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

In soft-margin SVM, we try to maximize
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j)$$
with respect to $a_i$, such that
$$∀_i: C ≥ a_i ≥ 0\textrm{~and~}∑_i a_i t_i = 0.$$

~~~
The KKT conditions for the solution can be reformulated (while staying
equivalent) as
$$\begin{aligned}
  a_i > 0 & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≤ 1,~\textrm{ because }a_i > 0 ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) = 1 - ξ_i\textrm{ and we have }ξ_i ≥ 0,\\
  a_i < C & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1,~\textrm{ because }a_i < C ⇒ μ_i > 0 ⇒ ξ_i = 0\textrm{ and }t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1 - ξ_i, \\
  0 < a_i < C & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) = 1,~\textrm{ a combination of both}.
\end{aligned}$$

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

At its core, the SMO algorithm is just a coordinate descent.

~~~
It tries to find such $a_i$ fulfilling the KKT conditions – once they are all
satisfied, an optimum has been reached, given that for soft-margin SVM
the KKT conditions are sufficient conditions for optimality (the loss is convex
and the inequality constraints affine).

~~~
However, note that because of the $∑a_i t_i = 0$ constraint we cannot optimize
just one $a_i$, because a single $a_i$ is determined from the others.

~~~
Therefore, in each step, we pick two $a_i, a_j$ coefficients and try to minimize
the loss while fulfilling the constraints.

~~~
<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence (until $∀ i: a_i < C ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1$ and $a_i > 0 ⇒  t_i y(→x_i) ≤ 1$)
  - for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$:
    - choose $j ≠ i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$
    - $a_i, a_j ← \argmin\nolimits_{a_i, a_j} L(a_1, a_2, …, a_D)$ such that $C ≥ a_i ≥ 0$, $∑_i a_i t_i = 0$
</div>

# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

The SMO is an efficient algorithm, because we can compute the update to
$a_i, a_j$ efficiently, because there exists an closed form solution.

~~~
Assume that we are updating $a_i$ and $a_j$. Then using the condition $∑_k a_k t_k = 0$ we can
write $a_i t_i = -∑_{k≠i} a_k t_k$. Given that $t_i^2 = 1$ and denoting $ζ=-∑_{k≠i, k≠j} a_k t_k$, we get
$$a_i = t_i (ζ-a_j t_j).$$

~~~
Maximizing $L(→a)$ with respect to $a_i$ and $a_j$ then amounts to maximizing
a quadratic function of $a_j$, which has an analytical solution.

~~~
Note that the real SMO algorithm has several heuristics for choosing $a_i, a_j$
such that the $L$ can be maximized the most.

# Sequential Minimal Optimization Update Rules

We already know that $a_i = t_i (ζ-a_j t_j).$

~~~
To find $a_j$ optimizing the loss $L$, we use the formula for locating a vertex
of a parabola
$$a_j^\textrm{new} ← a_j - \frac{∂L/∂a_j}{∂^2L/∂a_j^2},$$
which is in fact one Newton-Raphson iteration step.

~~~
Denoting $E_j ≝ y(→x_j) - t_j$, we can compute the first derivative as
$$\frac{∂L}{∂a_j} = t_j (E_i - E_j)$$
and the second derivative as
$$\frac{∂^2L}{∂a_j^2} = 2K(→x_i, →x_j) - K(→x_i, →x_i) - K(→x_j, →x_j).$$

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Update Rules

If the second derivative is negative, we know that the vertex is really
a maximum, in which case we get

$$a_j^\textrm{new} ← a_j - t_j\frac{E_i - E_j}{2K(→x_i, →x_j) - K(→x_i, →x_i) - K(→x_j, →x_j)}.$$

~~~
Our maximization problem is however constrained – it must hold that
$0 ≤ a_i, a_j ≤ C$.

~~~
![w=25%,f=right](box_constraints.svgz)

Recalling that $a_i = - t_i t_j a_j + \mathrm{const}$, we can plot the
dependence of $a_i$ and $a_j$. If for example $-t_i t_j=1$ and
$a_j^\textrm{new} > C$, we need to find the “right-most” solution
fulfilling both $a_i ≤ C$ and $a_j ≤ C$. Such a solution is either:
- when $a_j^\textrm{new}$ is clipped to $C$, as in the green case in the example,
~~~
- when $a_j^\textrm{new}$ is clipped so that $a_i^\textrm{new} = C$ (the purple
  case in the example), which is when $a_j^\textrm{new} = a_j + (C - a_i)$.

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Update Rules

If we consider both $t_i t_j = ±1$ and $a_j^\textrm{new} < 0$,
$a_j^\textrm{new} >C$, we get that the value maximizing the
Lagrangian is $a_j^\textrm{new}$ clipped to range $[L, H]$, where
$$\begin{aligned}
t_i = t_j & ⇒ L = \max(0, a_i + a_j - C), H = \min(C, a_i + a_j) \\
t_i ≠ t_j & ⇒ L = \max(0, a_j - a_i), H = \min(C, C + a_j - a_i).
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
After obtaining $a_j^\textrm{new}$ we can compute $a_i^\textrm{new}$.
Remembering that $a_i = - t_i t_j a_j + \mathrm{const}$, we
can compute it efficiently as
$$a_i^\textrm{new} ← a_i - t_i t_j\big(a_j^\textrm{new} - a_j).$$

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Update Rules

To arrive at the bias update, we consider the KKT condition that
for $0 < a_j^\textrm{new} < C$, it must hold that $t_j y(→x_j) = 1$. Combining it
with $b = E_j + t_j - ∑_l a_l t_l K(→x_j, →x_l)$, we get the following
value
$$b_j^\textrm{new} = b - E_j - t_i (a_i^\textrm{new} - a_i)K(→x_i, →x_j) - t_j (a_j^\textrm{new} - a_j)K(→x_j, →x_j).$$

~~~
Analogously for $0 < a_i^\textrm{new} < C$ we get
$$b_i^\textrm{new} = b - E_i - t_i (a_i^\textrm{new} - a_i)K(→x_i, →x_i) - t_j (a_j^\textrm{new} - a_j)K(→x_j, →x_i).$$

~~~
Finally, if $a_j^\textrm{new}, a_i^\textrm{new} ∈ \{0, C\}$, we know that all values between $b_i$ and $b_j$ fulfil the KKT conditions.
We therefore arrive at the following update for bias:
$$b^\textrm{new} = \begin{cases}
  b_i^\textrm{new} & \textrm{if~~} 0 < a_i^\textrm{new} < C \\
  b_j^\textrm{new} & \textrm{if~~} 0 < a_j^\textrm{new} < C \\
  \frac{b_i^\textrm{new} + b_j^\textrm{new}}{2} & \textrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$

# Multiclass SVM

There are two general approach for building a $K$-class classifier by combining
several binary classifiers:

~~~
- **one-versus-rest** scheme: $K$ binary classifiers are constructed, the $i$-th
  separating instances of class $i$ from all others; during prediction, the
  one with highest probability is chosen

  - the binary classifiers need to return calibrated probabilities (not SVM)

~~~
- **one-versus-one** scheme: $\binom{K}{2}$ binary classifiers are constructed,
  one for each $(i, j)$ pair of class indices; during prediction, the class with
  the majority of votes wins (used by SVM)

~~~
![w=50%,f=right](ovr_ovo_failures.svgz)

However, voting suffers from serious difficulties, because there usually exist
regions which are ambiguous.
